# Configuration

## Introduction

Spark is [Leboncoinâ€™s](https://www.leboncoin.com/) iOS Design System.

Its mission is to provide an easy to use, customizable UI experience for consumers.

This repository contains a SPM (Swift Package Manager) to manage the theming of Spark.

## Theming

The Spark theming is composed by:

- colors
- border (radius & width)
- elevation
- layout (spacing)
- typographies
- dims

## SPM

To open the project on Xcode, you just need to double click on the `Package.swift`.

The SPM is composed by

- Targets :

  - **SparkTheme**: Leboncoin theming implementation
  - **SparkTheming**: Theming protocols
  - **SparkThemingTesting**: Public theming mocks

- Unit Tests:
  - **SparkThemeUnitTests**: Unit tests for the Theme target
  - **SparkThemingUnitTests**: Unit tests for the Theming target

## Guidelines

There is two importants rules for this repository:

- All `protocols`, `class`, `struct`, `var/let/func`, ..., used by on other spark repositories or consummer application must be in **`public`** or **`open`**.
- If the code can be used only by the **spark iOS team**, all `public` or **`open`** must contains the **`@_spi(SI_SPI)`** annotation. If the code can also be used by consommer too, you don't need to add this annotation.
